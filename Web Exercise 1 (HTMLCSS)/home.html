        <p> While studying at University of Illinois-Champagne, Marc Andreessen developed the Mosaic browser with a small group of programmers in two months. <br>Mosaic gained large amounts of popularity partly due to it being free software (Around two million people were using it at the time).<br> After graduating, Andreessen partnered with James Clark (owner of Silicon Graphics Inc) band created the company called Mosaic but changed<br> it to Netscape due to copyright issues with the University of Illinois. Marc Andreessen, with the same group of programmers who originally<br> developed the first Mosaic browsers, created a new browser from scratch and named it Netscape which was <br>released in 1994 with large success which launched Marc Andreessen's career into success.</p>

        <p> Over the years, Marc Andreessen has gained experience in different companies as well as investing in start-up companies which has made him a <br>very successful businessman. Andreessen also founded Loudcloud Inc (renamed Opsware in 1999), which developed systems that could be related to "cloud based"<br> file services we have today such as Apple's iCloud and Google Drive. Loudcloud provided high speed, software services that could <br> be rented out to a business, much like personal cloud subscriptions we have today. Additionally, Marc Andreessen is well known<br> for being a successful investor as many start-up companies he invests are very successful such as Twitter and Qik.
