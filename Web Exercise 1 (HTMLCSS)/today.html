    <h2><u>Andreessen's Impact</u></h2>
    <p>The impact Andreessen that has made in previous years are still relevant today. The software, ideas and technology he has developed in the last few decades have molded<br> how we use the internet as well as how we access our resources. Without Netscape, the browser market would have been delayed or been more Microsoft focused which may have<br> resulted very differently. For example, without Netscape, many internet browsers would probably still have a big price tag on them. Also, graphical <br>internet browsers allowed the casual home owner to browse the internet, until that point, the world wide web was mainly used in military, education and business.</p>
    <p>As well as internet browsers, other software packages like Opsware shaped the way things would be in the future. Although Opsware was for businesses,<br> it was the first high performance cloud based service which is similar to the cloud based technology we have today, but<br> of course, it has developed a lot over the last few decades. Overall, the developments and ideas<br> Andreessen has developed and encouraged has impacted the way technology businesses function today.
