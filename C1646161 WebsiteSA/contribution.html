    <p>Many people consider Marc Andreessen to be the inventor of the graphical internet browser as before he developed Mosaic the world wide <br>web was mainly accessed through command based platforms which were not very user friendly as commands and a technical background was required to navigate through <br>pages to get information. Mosaic, later Netscape, allowed users to navigate with mouse clicks, graphical buttons and images. Mosaic was a big push in <br>the development of human computer interaction on the internet and allowed many businesses and individuals to use the internet without having to study technical documentation.

    <p>Loudcloud was founded in 1999 by Andreessen, it was one of the first ideas of using remote servers that run services for businesses on a <br>national scale. Loudcloud allowed business to rent out these services on a subscription scheme much like how modern cloud file storage subscriptions are used today.<br> The company was renamed Opsware in 2002 due to internal issues with employees. Opsware pushed forward the idea of having online <br>systems where businesses don't always need their own local server side services. Additionally, Andreessen partnered <br>with Ben Horowitz in 2009 to create a private investing company called Andreessen Horowitz. The company focused on investing in startup businesses<br> which help develop modern technology firms such as Oculus VR, Stack Overflow, Pinterest and BuzzFeed. Overall, as well as personal, business <br> and development contributions in Netscape and Opsware, Marc Andreessen has motivated and helped evolve many companies and technology firms financially.
